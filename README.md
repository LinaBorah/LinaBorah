# I am Lina Borah
<p><span>I </span> am a front-end Web developer, specialised in react.
                        I like to build interactive, creative,
                        and visually appealing websites, that gives a good
                        user experience. My particular area of experience and interest is
                        in front-end development, and UI designing.
                        <p>I previously worked as a technical support associate
                        for more than 2 years,
                        where my work area included working closely
                        with the client and solving their technical issues,
                        because of this I know, what user wants when
                        they work with software, and therefore user
                        experience is one of my priority while building websites.</p>
                        <p>
                        I have experience in
                        designing and developing front end part of websites, and I am learning
                        backend technologies like nodeJS, MySQL database and planning to learn
                        Laravel framework.</p>
                        <p>
                        I constantly upskill myself with new technologies,
                        so that I can use them to solve
                        technical problems by writing reusable and efficient codes.
                        Currently,
                        I am working on expanding my skillset
                        to back-end development as well, so that
                        I can become a Full stack developer.
                        </p>
                        </p>
